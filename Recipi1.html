                                    <li>Sour the whole milk with lemon juice.</li>

                                    <li>Make small balls of the size of dime.</li>
                                    <li>In a sauce pan boil 3 cups of water and sugar together.</li>
                                    <li>When it starts to boil, drop in the chenna balls.</li>
                                    <li>On medium heat cover the pan and let it simmer for 1/2 an hour. If you have Indian style pressure cooker keep the lid closed with whistle on for 15 minutes on a VERY LOW HEAT(extremely important). switch off the heat.Frequently stir it so that the chenna balls don't stick to each other.</li>
                                    <li>In another pan boil heavy cream, 2 cups of whole milk and saffron strands. Add 5 tablespoon of sugar.</li>
                                    <li>Keep simmering for 20 minutes until the milk becomes thickened, taking care not to scorch.</li>
                                    <li>Now take out the chenna balls from the sugar syrup.</li>
                                    <li>While the whipping cream and whole milk is still simmering, drop in the chenna balls in it and simmer for another 15 minutes on low heat.</li>

                                    <li>Place 1 cup cashews (kaju) in a dry grinder or coffee grinder or blender</li>
                                    <li>Grind the kaju to a smooth powder, making sure you don’t over do the grinding process as fat should not release from the cashews.</li>
                                    <li>Combine ½ cup sugar and 5 tablespoons water in a thick bottomed pan (or kadai or a non-stick pan).</li>
                                    <li> Keep on low flame and let the sugar dissolve in the water. There is no consistency in the sugar syrup like one string or two string. Simply let the sugar dissolve in the water and then proceed with the next step.</li>
                                    <li>When the sugar completely dissolves in the water, add the cashew powder.</li>
                                    <li>Stir and keep on stirring non-stop on a low flame. If there are lumps then break the lumps as you stir and continue to stir. This consistent stirring is the key for a smooth and even kaju katli dough.</li>
                                    <li>The mixture will thicken and start coming together to form a very soft dough. Then it is time to remove the whole lump of the mixture from the pan and place it on a work surface.</li>
                                    <li>Put the entire cashew dough on a work surface. Add 1 teaspoon rose petals (or 1 teaspoon rose water or 8 to 9 strands of saffron) and 1 tablespoon ghee or coconut oil.</li>
                                    <li>Knead the dough lightly, flatten it and place it on a greased plate or tray. Don't overdo kneading as this will release fat from the cashews. </li>
                                    <li> You can also place it on a large piece of parchment or butter paper. The cashew dough should still be quite warm when you start rolling it</li>
                                    <li>Once cooled completely, cut the cashew dough into squares or diamond shapes. Scrape off the uneven edges and enjoy as a little snack as you work.</li>
